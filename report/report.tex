\section{Introduction}
IMDB is a website in which all moves data are collected, but, there isn't a built-in visual tool to analyzed these data, to analyze the data we have to open multiple pages and comparing data in a manual way.\newline
The main use cases for this software could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To discover new movies based by some criteria
	\item To discover new movies or similar to movies that you had already seen and you had like.
	\item To find trends, insights and curiosities on a large dataset of movies
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset}
\subsection{The used dataset}
The used dataset is the one called \quotes{\href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset}{The Movies Dataset}} available on Kaggle, this dataset contains about 5000 movies from the 1917 until 2017.\newline
The dataset is composed by 7 csv files, but we use only 3 of them:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\quotes{movie\_metadata.csv}}: This file has 24 columns and it contains the main information of the movies.
	\item \textbf{\quotes{keywords.csv}}: This file includes the keywords of each movies.
	\item \textbf{\quotes{credits.csv}}: This file contains information about the people who worked on the movies. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dataset processing}
The dataset needs a data elaboration to create a new dataset customized for our tool, in this way we avoid to perform heavy computation in \quotes{realtime} in the visualization tool and we drop the useless data in order to have a small dataset with a quicker loading time.\newline
This pre-processing phase is made by a python script and it is composed by 2 main phases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In this phase we merge all the data from the different files and we drop the movies which contains invalid data, like empty fields or invalid formats.
	\item This step computes the needed information for the multidimensional reduction, it is subdivided in 2 sub-phases:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Build of similarity matrix}\newline
		 We have build a similarity matrix in which each cell $ij$ is filled with the similarity between the keywords of the movies $i$ and $j$
		\item \textbf{MultiDimensional Scaling positions}\newline
		Starting from the similarity matrix we compute the position of each movie in the multidimensional scaling plot.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
After the previous elaboration we have for each movie these fields:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{id} An integer used to identify the movies.
	\item \textbf{Title} The original title of the movies.
	\item \textbf{Genres} The genres of the movies.
	\item \textbf{Release year} The release year of the movies.
	\item \textbf{Runtime} The runtime in minutes.
	\item \textbf{Spoken languages} The spoken languages of the movies.
	\item \textbf{Vote avg} The average of the votes.
	\item \textbf{Vote count} The amount of the votes.
	\item \textbf{Revenue} The revenue in dollars.
	\item \textbf{Popularity} A popularity decimal value assigned by IMDB.
	\item \textbf{Budget} The budget in dollars.
	\item \textbf{Keywords}	The keywords of each movies, they are not directly used by the tool, but they can be useful to understand if the MDS works well.
	\item \textbf{MDS position} The coordinates of each movie in the MDS plot.
	\item \textbf{Director} The movie's director.
\end{itemize}
So we have 14 fields and 4943 movies, this makes the AS index equal to $69202$ definitely bigger than the suggested one, so we have created also the option to filter the dataset taking only the top 1000 movies by popularity, with this smaller dataset we have an AS index of $1400$ giving a smoother user interaction, expacially on low-end PC.\newline
\section{Visualization Techniques}
\subsection{Main interface}
The tool include a short header with the project name and an option to select the two type of dataset, can be selected the full dataset with about 5000 movies or the smaller one with only the top 1000 movies by popularity.\newline
Since the dataset has a dimension of about 5 MB, the loading of the page can take some time if the user has a slow internet connection, so there is also a nice interface shown in the loading phase.
\subsection{Multidimensional scaling}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/mds_plot}
	\caption{Multidimensional plot}
	\label{fig:mdsplot}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Pre-Processing phase}
Multi-dimension scaling is a technique to show graphically the similarity between a set of elements, starting from a similarity matrix in which we have an item for each row and column, we can use an appropriate algorithm to set a position of the element in a N-dimensions space, in our case into a 2D space.\newline
In this project we compute the similarity using the Jaccard distance between the keywords of each movies, the Jaccard distance is defined as $J(A,B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$, initially we have tried to use the cosine similarity but we had bad results, while with the Jaccard distance the outcomes are definitely better.\newline
Each movie has a set of keywords, each keyword has also an associated id, so for each movies is easy to get a vector with all the associated ids of the keywords, avoiding addition processes to have the keywords as numbers, from these vector of integers we can apply the Jaccard distance to get the similarity between the set of keywords.\newline
Once we have the similarity matrix we have used the sklearn.MDS function with parameters max\_iter=1000, dissimilarity="precomputed", n\_init=8, eps=1e-6, to computes the position in the 2D plane for each movie.\newline
The described computations are not done in real time by the webpage, because they are processes which took a lot of time, so they are done previusly with a python script in order to have inside the dataset directly the outcome helpful to draw this graph.
\subsubsection{Visualization tool}
In graph we have a set of dots, each dots represents a movie, the user can hover the mouse on a dot to see addition information (Movie title, Director and release year) and to highlight the movie on the other plots.\newline
The visualization tool has two modes: the zoom mode and the select mode, with the zoom mode the user can zoom and move the visualized area of the graph, while in select mode the user can select an area drawing a rectangle.
\subsection{Parallel coordinates}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/parallel_plot}
	\caption{Parallel coordinates plot}
	\label{fig:parallelplot}
\end{figure}
Parallel coordinates is a technique uses to visualize multidimensional data through parallel axes in a 2D chart. In out case each axis represent an attribute of the movie.\newline
The visualized attributes are: genres, release year, average rate, number of rates, runtime and the spoken languages, genres and languages are discrete values, while the other attributes are linear values.\newline
The user can highlight a movie or makes a selection brushing a range selection on the axes.
\subsection{Bubble plot}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/bubble_plot}
	\caption[Bubble plot]{}
	\label{fig:bubbleplot}
\end{figure}
In the bubble plot we can visualize every continuous attribute present in the dataset, the user can select the attribute for the axes X and Y, and he can also aggregate by a specific field, when the aggregation is enabled each bubble has a specific radius and color, the radius indicates the amount of elements inside the bubble, and the color the range of the selected field inside the bubble.
For example in the plot shown in the figure \ref{fig:bubbleplot} each bubble has the center in a point when the X position indicates the runtime and the Y position the average rate, the elements are grouped by the revenue, so for example the dark brown bubble represents that the movies with a revenue between 1 million and 278.8 millions are between 292 and 4510.\newline
The chosen colors are picked using \href{https://colorbrewer2.or}{ColorBrew2} and they are colorblind safe.\newline
In this graph is also possible to visualize only the movies of a specific year using the bottom slider, it is also possible to automatically go forward with the years clicking the button \quotes{play}.
\subsection{Column plot}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/column_plot}
	\caption[Column plot]{}
	\label{fig:columnplot}
\end{figure}
A column plot is build with a series of parallel columns to the axis X, the height of each column represents the value of the Y axis, in our case the amount of elements.\newline
Each column contains multiple segments of different colors, each color represents the genre of a movie and if for example a movie genre is both action and adventure, the movie will be counted twice.\newline
It is possible to choose different fields for the X axis, the user can choose between: release year, runtime, average rate, number of rates, revenue, popularity and budget. There are some fields in which all the possible values can be displayed, for example the years like in figure \ref{fig:columnplot}, while there are other fields that are impossible to represents all the value, for example the budget, so the column represent an aggregated value, for instance the first column represents the movies with a budget between 1 millions and 19M, the second from 19M and 38M and so on. The user can apply a zoom on a specific area drawing a rectangle with the mouse, when the user zoom on an area composed by aggregated value, if there is enough space, the graph disable the aggregation and show the value singularly, otherwise the aggregation is still present.
\subsection{Selection list}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/selection_list}
	\caption[Selection list]{List of selected movies}
	\label{fig:selectionlist}
\end{figure}
When a selection is made, the list of the selected movies is displayed in the bottom right area, the list is in alphabetical order and shown the title of the movie and director name.
\subsection{Interaction}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/interaction1}
	\caption[Interaction example]{An example of selection in multiple plots}
	\label{fig:interaction1}
\end{figure}
Each interaction on a graph triggers some events also in the other graphs, the implemented interaction regarding the selection are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mouse hover:} When the mouse is hover an element, this item is colored by yellow and also in the other graphs the element associated to the same movies is colored by yellow. Therefore a popup to show some information of the movie is shown.
	\item \textbf{Selection:} When the user select some elements on a graph, the selected elements are highlighted also on the other graphs. If the user makes a selection on multiple graph, the highlighted elements are the common movies between the selection of the graphs.
\end{itemize}
